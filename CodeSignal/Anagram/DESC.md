# Problem: Anagram
## Problem Statement:

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. Write a function `isAnagram` that returns `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s` and `false` otherwise.

Implement function `isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool` where
- s: A string of lowercase letters
- t: A string of lowercase letters

### Example

Input:
```
s = "anagram"
t = "nagaram"
```

Output:
```
true
```

Explanation:
```
The two strings contain the same letters, so `t` is an anagram of `s`.
```

### Constraints

- The length of the strings `s` and `t` will be between 1 and 5*10^4.
- The strings `s` and `t` will only contain lowercase letters.

### Note

In the example above, the strings `s` and `t` contain the same letters, but in a different order. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated on the following criteria:
- Correctness: Your code should return the correct output for all test cases.
- Performance: Your code should complete all test cases within the time limit.
- Clarity: Your code should be easy to read and understand.
